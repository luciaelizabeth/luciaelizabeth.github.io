I'm currently focusing on projects related to the interaction between language and gesture, dialogue with [Communicative Robots](http://makerobotstalk.nl/), and an [Interactive Cookbook](https://github.com/interactive-cookbook) that adapts recipe instructions to users. Underlying many of these tasks is the question of how formal and symbolic representations
can be integrated for better performance. I am also part of [the Hybrid Intelligence Center](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl), where I research topics related to collaborative and ethical partnerships between humans and AI.
