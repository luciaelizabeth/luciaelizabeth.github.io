I am Assistant Professor in the [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL)](http://www.cltl.nl)
at [Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl). My research focuses on natural language understanding with the broad goal
to develop computational models capable of understanding language in human-like ways. For more about my research, see [Research](https://luciaelizabeth.github.io/about/).
