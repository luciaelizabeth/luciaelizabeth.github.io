I am Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://www.cltl.nl">Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL)</a> 
at <a href="https://vu.nl/nl">Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam</a>. My research focuses on natural language understanding with the broad goal
to develop computational models capable of understanding language in human-like ways. I'm currently focusing on projects related to situated language 
understanding in human-robot dialogue, developing an Interactive Cookbook dialogue system, and generally asking how symbolic representations
can facilitate these tasks.
