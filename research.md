I currently have projects related to the following topics: 

- Formally modeling interactions between language and gesture, specifically to identify and generate gesture "signatures" unique to individuals and groups
- Situated dialogue with [Communicative Robots](http://makerobotstalk.nl/)
- [The Interactive Cookbook](https://github.com/interactive-cookbook), a dialogue system that adapts recipe instructions to users
- Compositional generalization of semantic parsers

Underlying many of these tasks is the question of how formal and symbolic representations can be integrated into computational models for increased interpretability and to emulate human-like language understanding and generalization to out-of-domain structures. 

I am also part of [the Hybrid Intelligence Center](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl), where I research topics related to collaborative and ethical partnerships between humans and AI.
